# Project: ⭕️❌ Enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe

## 🙊 Description

This is an enhanced version of the tic-tac-toe game, which is used as the tutorial in ReactJS's docs.

## 🥞 Tech Stack

Bundler: Vite
JS Framework: ReactJS
CSS: CSS Modules (can remove), Tailwind, PostCSS, Headless UI
Type Check: TypeSript

## 🦄 Unique Features

- Different cursor status on clickable and unclickable square
- Support 5 different board sizes: 3\*3 to 7\*7

- square slightly enlarge when hovered on
